# ASTEROIDSgame

Simple game inspired by Asteroids, written in JavaScript with the help of P5.js library.

-- I made this game just for fun and to try some JS and P5.js skills i was learning, also it is not ended (e.g. no ship images, no menu, no tutorial etc..) --

You can actually try it at http://federicomainettigambera.altervista.org/ASTEROIDS

BASIC TUTORIAL:

A to move left
D to move right
S to activate a shield around you that makes you immortal for a little time
SPACEBAR to shoot, every bullet wastes 1 energy
top-right corner : life indicator
top-left corner : current stats
bottom red line : boss coming bar, every time you hit an asteroids it charges
little yellow circles gives you energy
after killing a boss you step in to the shop and to the next level
HAVE FUN BYE
